      <p>
        Some of our products offer paid features or subscriptions. By purchasing

        Limitation of Liability<span class="text-warning">.</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        We work hard to keep our products reliable, secure, and available.
        However, no software is perfect — bugs happen, servers hiccup, and
        things occasionally break. We can't promise 100% uptime or a
        completely error-free experience, but we're always working to improve.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        If something does go wrong, our responsibility is limited to
        refunding what you paid us in the last month. We're a small team
        building open-source software, and this helps us keep doing that.
      </p>

        you violate these Terms, without prior notice. You may stop using our
        products at any time by deleting your account.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">

        provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive
        termination will remain in effect.
